                            Unlike JavaScript the TypeScript language was
                            built to generate the types for the user automatically.
                            Therefore, allowing programmers to assign variables to a particular
                            value without specifying the type.

                            For Example, in TypeScript assigning a value to a variable would look like this,

                            <br>

                                let hellowWorld = "Hello World";
